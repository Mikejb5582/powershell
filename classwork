    Create an array containing a range with a random starting and stopping point.  The starting point will be a random number from -10 through 0.
    The ending point will be a random number from 1 through 20.
        [array]$tired = (get-random -minimum -10 -maximum 0)..(get-random -minimum 1 -maximum 20)
    Create a variable that contains the contents of the array in reverse
        $reverse = $array[($array.length-1) ** reverses array as new variable
        [array]::reverse($tired)..0] ** reverses array
